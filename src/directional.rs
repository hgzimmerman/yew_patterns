//! By using senders and receivers, components can set up message basses between themselves.
//! One or more components can create senders, and one or more components can create receivers,
//! and as long as they share the same type `T`, the message will be routed to the desired outputs.
//!
//! This provides the ability to avoid the "callback hell" incurred when a component needs to affect
//! the state of another component that is far away in the component hierarchy.
